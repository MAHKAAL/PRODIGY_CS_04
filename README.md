# PRODIGY_CS_04
**This is my projects work which has been assigned during my internship period at Prodigy InfoTech.**

1. To implement a simple keylogger program in python, I've used pynput library which takes every single key input after importin keyboard module.
2. I have used logging module to save all the key inputs with time stamp in a text file.
3. This improved my understandig about use of Keyloggers and also brought an increase in my skills and understanding of necessity of Cyber Security.
